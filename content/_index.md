# Welcome 

If you've never encountered projective geometry before, you're in for a treat. Like everything new, it can take some time to understand it. We'll just dive right in.

One of the deepest aspects of projective geometry is the principle of *duality*, whereby every figure or theorem has a dual partner. One of the most famous pair of dual theorems Pascal's Theorem (1640), and Brianchon's Theorem (1814). We present the theorems using two columns, a traditional feature of writings on projective geometry. The reader can confirm that the theorems differ only by a small subset of terms, that will be discussed in more detail elsewhere on this site.

<p>The meeting points of opposite sides of a hexagon inscribed in a conic section are collinear. </p>
</div>

### Discussion
The hexagon is given in the figure by $ABCA'B'C'$. The six sides are $\{AB,BC,CA',A'B',B'C',C'A\}$. Their intersections of opposite sides are $A'' = BC \wedge B'C' $, etc. These three points always lie on a line!
