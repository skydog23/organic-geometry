# Welcome 

If you've never encountered projective geometry before, you're in for a treat. Like everything new, it can take some time to understand it. We'll just dive right in.

One of the deepest aspects of projective geometry is the principle of *duality*, whereby every figure or theorem has a *dual* partner. One of the most famous pair of dual theorems **Pascal's Theorem** (1640), and **Brianchon's Theorem* (1814). We present the theorems using two columns, a traditional feature of writings on projective geometry. The reader can confirm that the theorems differ only by a small subset of terms, that will be discussed in more detail later.

## Pascal's Theorem

<p>The meeting points of opposite sides of a hexagon inscribed in a conic section lie on a common line. </p>
</div>

### Discussion
The hexagon is given in the figure by $ABCA'B'C'$. The six sides are $\{AB,BC,CA',A'B',B'C',C'A\}$. The intersections of opposite sides are $A'' = BC \wedge B'C' $, etc. These three points always lie on a line!

## Brianchon's Theorem

The joining lines of opposite vertices of a hexalateral circumscribed around a conic section are co-punctual.

### Discussion
The hexalateral is given in the figure by $abca'b'c'$. The six vertices are the intersection points $\{ab, bc, ca', a'b', b'c', c'a\}$. The joining lines of opposite vertices are $a'' = bc \vee b'c'$, etc. These three lines have a common point.
