## Testing ganja code in html

On this page I want to test including ganja code directly in the post. This will allow me then to convert the ganja notebooks that I have created into Hugo pages.

<div id="animation"  width:100%; height:100%; background:#ffffcc">
Here's some text.
</div>
<script src="/js/ganja/testGanja.js"></script>
