## Testing ganja code in html

On this page I want to test including ganja code directly in the post. This will allow me then to convert the ganja notebooks that I have created into Hugo pages.

<div id="animation"  width:100%; height:100%; background:#ffffcc">
You can drag the center of the animated circle.
</div>

{{< script "js/ganja/testGanja.js" >}}
